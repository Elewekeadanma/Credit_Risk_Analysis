# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk to help provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. Hopefully, this analysis will provide a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to low default rates.
##  Results
In this project, 4 algorithms were used: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids and SMOTEENN.
