# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk to help provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. Hopefully, this analysis will provide a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to low default rates.

##  Results
In this project, 4 algorithms were used: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids and SMOTEENN.
For the RandomOverSampler algorithms, I got a balanced accuracy score of 0.65,precision scores 0f 0.01 for the high risk and 1 for the low risk; recall score of 0.73 for high risk and .57 for low risk applications.

For the SMOTE algorithm, I got a balanced accuracy score of 0.69, precision scores of 0.01 for high risk and 1 for low risk; recall scores of 0.68 for high risk and 0.63 for low risk applications.
